# oracle-test
Data visualization app as a job test
This application aims to visualize the data received from an external entity with the following structure ( similar to Zeppelin ) :

Column A \ t Column B \ t Column C \ t Column D \ n1 \ t2 \ t3 \ t4 \ na \ tb \ tc \ td ``

This data has to respect some conditions :Â 

Except for the header, all values must be numeric.
The dataset count has to be equal to the headers count
I hope you enjoy the application

to install it just tab npm install
